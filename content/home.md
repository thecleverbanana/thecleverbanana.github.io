# Jerry Wu （吴越）
Hi, I am Jerry, my legal name is Yue Wu. I am currently a 4th year undergraduate majoring Electrical and Computer Engineering in [Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California](https://www.viterbi.usc.edu/)
. My recent research interests mainly focus on robots locomotion and machine learning, supervised by Professor [Feifei Qian](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/roboland) and Professor [Dainel Seita](https://danielseita.github.io/).

During summer 2025, I was fortunate to work with Professor [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) on Humanoid Robot. Before joined the research labs,  I was part of [USC Racing Team](https://www.uscformulasae.com/), where I mainly contributed to the Electronics subteam.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and sometimes even help friends with their film projects. I appreciate all kinds of cinema, especially emerging forms such as VR, AR and AI generated movies.
